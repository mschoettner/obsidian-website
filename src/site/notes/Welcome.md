| When it comes to analyzing data, you need the right tool for the right job. Depending on the task, I use everything from **descriptive stats, to statistical models, machine learning, or deep learning**, and I am always eager to add more tools to my belt. | A picture says more than a thousand words, and the same is true for graphs. Vital for both exploring data and presenting results, I use **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for static graphs and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations. | The best analysis pipeline is only worth it if it is communicated effectively. In my work, I combine **strong presentation skills** with the ability to **communicate complex results to non-technical audiences**. |


## Projects

### Behavioral Domains
[Github Repository](https://github.com/connectomicslab/hcp-behavioral-domains) [Journal Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27101-1)
The structure of our behavior, meaning what traits make up what we do and how we think, is one of the central questions in psychology and neuroscience. In this work, I used **factor analysis**, an **unsupervised learning** technique to explore this question. Through a combination of methods, I found four central behavioral domains in this dataset. This work resulted in a [publication in Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27101-1).

### MRIQC Quality Metrics
[Github Repository](https://github.com/brainhack-ch/interpret-iqms/tree/main),  [Report](https://www.nipreps.org/qc-book/auto-qc/iqms_interpretability.html)
[MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an open source package for quality control of functional magnetic resonance images of the brain. In this project, which I co-lead as part of the [Brainhack Geneva 2022](https://memento.epfl.ch/event/brainhack-global-geneva-2022-register-or-propose-y/), we used various machine learning models implemented with **Scikit-Learn** in combination with the image quality metrics generated by MRIQC to predict the quality rating of each scan. This project resulted in a [conference abstract](https://osf.io/7vqzr/) presented at OHBM 2023 in Montréal.

### Connectomemapper3 Tutorial
[Tutorial Page](https://connectome-mapper-3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/analysis_tutorial.html)
[Connectomemapper3](https://connectome-mapper-3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is an open source analysis software to process neuroimaging data for connectivity analysis. In this project, I wrote a tutorial on how to load and analyze the data with **NetworkX, SciPy and Pandas** and visualize the outputs using **Matplotlib and Nilearn**.
